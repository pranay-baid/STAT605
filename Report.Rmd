  In conducting our project, we chose to analyze Amazon customer review data. Specifically, we aimed to discover the correlation between the sentiment of the words in reviews and the rating scores given. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the difference in this correlation between several different product categories. The data we used was a public archive.zip from Kaggle, and contained within this file were 22 Gigabytes of data, organized into 37 .tsv files based on product categories. {discuss statistical computation and conclusion here}.
